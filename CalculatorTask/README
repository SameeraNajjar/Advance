Functional Interfaces and Lambdas: Calculator Implementation
Project Overview

This project demonstrates the difference between Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming in Java by implementing a simple calculator. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

The project is divided into two parts:

    OOP Implementation: A traditional class-based approach with methods for each arithmetic operation.

    Functional Implementation: A functional programming approach using a Calculator interface and lambda expressions for each operation.

This task is part of Practical Lecture #3 and is designed to help students understand the concepts of functional interfaces and lambda expressions in Java.
Functional Requirements
Part A: OOP Implementation

    Create a class OOPCalculator with methods for:

        Addition

        Subtraction

        Multiplication

        Division

        Modulus

    Test the calculator with different pairs of input numbers.

Part B: Functional Implementation

    Define a functional interface Calculator with a single abstract method:
    java
    Copy

    double calculate(double a, double b);

    Implement four lambda expressions for:

        Addition

        Subtraction

        Multiplication

        Division

    Test the calculator with different pairs of input numbers.
