Functional Interfaces and Lambdas: Calculator Implementation
Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple calculator using both Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming approaches in Java. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
Part A: OOP Implementation

    OOPCalculator Class:
        Implements methods for:
            Addition
            Subtraction
            Multiplication
            Division
            Modulus

    Testing:
        Tests each arithmetic operation with different input pairs to ensure functionality.

Part B: Functional Implementation

    Calculator Functional Interface:
        Defines a functional interface Calculator with the method:

    double calculate(double a, double b);

Lambda Expressions:

    Implements lambda expressions for:
        Addition
        Subtraction
        Multiplication
        Division

Testing:

    Validates each lambda expression by testing with various input pairs.
