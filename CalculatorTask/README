# Functional Interfaces and Lambdas: Calculator Implementation

Project Overview

This project demonstrates the difference between **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Functional Programming** in Java by implementing a simple calculator. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

The project is divided into two parts:
1. **OOP Implementation**: A traditional class-based approach with methods for each arithmetic operation.
2. **Functional Implementation**: A functional programming approach using a `Calculator` interface and lambda expressions for each operation.

This task is part of **Practical Lecture #3** and is designed to help students understand the concepts of functional interfaces and lambda expressions in Java.

Functional Requirements:

Part A: OOP Implementation
1. Create a class `OOPCalculator` with methods for:
    - Addition
    - Subtraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division
    - Modulus
